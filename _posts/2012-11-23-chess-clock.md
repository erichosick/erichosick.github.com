## Introduction

I work too much and it has been affecting my personal life: **in a bad way**. So, I started using a chess clock.

## Why A Chess Clock

To manage expectations of others and myself. We think we own 100% of our own time but do we? What about sleep? Significant others? Family? The Dentist?

I've committed to those close to me, and myself, that I will not work more than 9 hours a day.

## It's About Deliverables: Not Hours

This is very true. It's working smart not hard, right?

However, as an entrepreneur, there is always more stuff that can be done. Another video to make. Finish up a new blog post. Another feature to deliver. It is so easy to start that next deliverable: 15 hours into a day.

## Does This Help With Motivation?

I am not sure how this affects motivation. Feedback from others who have tried/will try this would be great.

I do have "less time" in the day to get work done so I am tempted to work "harder" during the time I have allotted to work.

## How Does It Work

It's really easy. I set the chess clock to 9 hours (though 8 hours seems more reasonable). When I am interrupted by someone, need to take a break, need to eat, etc. I "end my turn" working. That's it. When I hit the 9 hours I am done for the day.

I'm using [Clock Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clock-pro-hd/id376826715) as my Chess clock. I'm sure there are other solutions out there (including a physical Chess Clock) and would like to hear from others.

## Conclusion

If you are an over-motivated workaholic entrepreneur then try a Chess Clock.
