<p>One question we’ve been asked is how fast is the Vision framework? To answer that, we’ve created parts (aka messages) that can be used to configure a web server from scratch. The results are shown below.</p>

  <p>We realize the comparison is <strong>not</strong> apples to apples but we wanted to have something we can start comparing to.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the <a href="/design/design-composition-based-language">SipCoffee</a> message-configuration that gave us these results.</p>

<h2 id="quick-introduction-to-sipcoffee">Quick Introduction to SipCoffee</h2>

<p>SipCoffee is a message-oriented programming language. By that, we mean that all parts within the language are considered messages. A message contains some specific behavior and an aggregate of named-message (a class (message) with computed properties (named-messages)).</p>

<p>A program is created by composing messages. This can also be viewed as creating a data structure which contains both data and behavior (behavior and data-structures are inseparable: as they should be).</p>

<p>When a message is activated, the behavior composed within the message is executed. This may cause named-message (those computed properties of the message) to also active.</p>

<p>We call SipCoffee programs message-configurations because we’ve completely separated mechanisms from the business domain. Any changes you make in a program are directly related to the business domain.</p>

<p>In the message-configuration below, you can twiddle with the Web Server at any level. You can change queue sizes, time out periods, the server port and uri, the number of parts in a part pool, and even the cache size of the socket reader.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-web-server-from-scratch">Building A Web Server From Scratch</h2>

<p>The following is the message-configuration of a very very simple, but complete, WebServer in only <strong>50 lines</strong> of SipCoffee.</p>

<pre><code>Scope ( scopeId -2

</code></pre>

<p>Example messages are <strong>Scope</strong>, <strong>File</strong>, <strong>ArrayByteBuilder</strong>, <strong>ArrayByte</strong> and <strong>Socket</strong> (all implemented as classes). Example named-messages are <em>ins</em>, <em>named</em>, <em>sizeGrowBy</em> and <em>withName</em> (all implemented as computed properties).</p>

<p>Let’s break the message-configuration down into smaller parts we can easily explain.</p>

<h3 id="the-socketrouter-message">The SocketRouter Message</h3>

<p>The <strong>SocketRouter</strong> message, when activated, listens to a data stream on a given port. Any new connections on that data stream are forwarded to another data stream for handling.</p>

<p>The <strong>SocketRouter</strong> has two named-messages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>streamSource - The source of all data streams.</li>
  <li>socketFactory - The message-configuration that handles reading from and writing to of any incoming data streams.</li>
</ul>

<p>The message-configuration for the <em>streamSource</em> named-message is very simple. </p>

<pre><code>streamSource SocketListener ( backlogQueueSize 2000 
  ipEndPoint IPEndPoint ( port 3050 
    ipAddress DNSLookup ( hostEntryStr "localhost" )
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>streamSource</em> named-message is a <strong>SocketListener</strong> message with a <em>backlogQueueSize</em> named-message of a <strong>2000</strong> message (Yep! 2000 is also a message) and a configured <em>ipEndPoint</em> which is easy to figure out.</p>

<p>The <em>socketFactory</em> named-message is a bit more complicated. We could configure our Web Server to handle one request at a time. However, that isn’t very practical and scales worth shit. We need a way to allow messages to run on multiple threads at the same time.</p>

<p>To do this, we can use factories and part pools.</p>

<h3 id="the-factoryinstance-partpool-and-partpooldecorator-messages">The FactoryInstance, PartPool and PartPoolDecorator Messages</h3>

<p>A <strong>FactoryInstance</strong> message, when activated, will return a copy of the message-configuration located in the <em>part</em> named-message.</p>

<ul>
  <li>part - The message-configuration we’ll make a copy of.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our message-configuration is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>FactoryInstance (
  part PartPoolDecorator (
    ...
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p>In the above message-configuration, the <strong>FactoryInstance</strong> message creates a copy of a <strong>PartPoolDecorator</strong> and all messages configured in the <strong>PartPoolDecorator</strong> message. This is one of the advantages of programming using data structures as opposed to parameterized functions. Want to create a copy of a program? Just duplicate it (Functions are great at manipulating data structures but don’t make for very good data-structures in and of themselves).</p>

<p>We could implement our Web Server using only the <strong>FactoryInstance</strong> message-configuration. Each time a request comes in, a copy of the message-configuration to handle the request is made and ran in it’s own thread (more on that below). However, why keep making copies of our message-configuration for every request by a client? Allocating and freeing memory are expensive operations. We should be able to re-use our copied message-configurations. This is where the <strong>PartPool</strong> and <strong>PartPoolDecorator</strong> messages come into play.</p>

<p>The messages <strong>PartPool</strong> and <strong>PartPoolDecorator</strong>, together, allow any message-configuration to be re-used multiple times throughout the execution of a program.</p>

<p>The <strong>PartPool</strong> message is simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>initialSize - The initial number of parts in the pool. If all the parts in the pool are in use, a new item is created and added to the part pool.</li>
  <li>item - The message-configuration that is pooled by the <strong>PartPool</strong> message. This is always configured with some kind of factory. The item’s message-configuration is activated initialSize number of times and the result pooled inside the <strong>PartPool</strong> message.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>PartPoolDecorator</strong> message, when activated, activates the message contained in the <em>part</em> named-message. When the configured-message in <em>part</em> finishes, the <strong>PartPoolDecorator</strong> message automatically returns itself to it’s part pool.</p>

<ul>
  <li>part - The configured message to activate. When the message is finished, the <strong>PartPoolDecorator</strong> places itself back into the <strong>PartPool</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using these two messages in conjunction with a factory, we can take <strong>any</strong> message-configuration and make it re-usable. This allows us to configure very scalable message-configurations.</p>

<p>Our specific message-configuration is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>PartPool ( initialSize 500
  item FactoryInstance (
    part PartPoolDecorator (
      part RunWorkerWithTimeOut (
        ... 
      ) ) ) )
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>PartPool</strong> message starts out with an initialSize named-message of <strong>500</strong>. When the PartPool is first activated, the <strong>FactoryInstance</strong> message is activated 500 times (on as many threads as we can) and the results are placed in the <strong>PartPool</strong> message. The <strong>PartPool</strong> pulls a single message from it’s pool and activates it.</p>

<p>In this case, the <strong>PartPoolDecorator</strong> is configured to contain a <strong>RunWorkerWithTimeOut</strong> message. This means the <strong>PartPoolDecorator</strong> is actually activated in a new thread meaning the <strong>PartPool</strong> returns control, almost immediately, to it’s parent message: the <strong>SocketRouter</strong> message. The <strong>SocketRouter</strong> message is now ready to handle the next incoming request.</p>

<h3 id="the-runworkerwithtimeout-message">The RunWorkerWithTimeOut Message</h3>

<p>Here are where things get even cooler. The <strong>RunWorkerWithTimeOut</strong> message is able to run <strong>any</strong> message-configuration in a thread. Yep. Multi-threaded programming in SipCoffee is just that simple.</p>

<ul>
  <li>waitTime - The time in milliseconds before the worker thread times out.</li>
  <li>part - The message-configuration to run within the worker thread.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-scope-and-scopeget-messages">The Scope and ScopeGet Messages</h3>

<p>Take a quick look at the original message-configuration. What you will notice is that there are no functions, parameters or variables. In message-oriented programming, <strong>everything is a message</strong>. Even the context/scope that a message is activated in, usually defined with a language using { and } (Defining context in a language isn’t very data-structure friendly), is a message.</p>

<p>To support context, we have a <strong>Scope</strong> message to define the context a message-configuration runs in.</p>

<ul>
  <li>part - The configured-message to activate within the context.</li>
  <li>ins - One or more configured-messages contained within the context of the scope. These can also be viewed as Variables.</li>
  <li>scopeId - When configured with a negative numeric message, the scope is “global” in nature. When not configured, the scopeId is based on the managed thread id a message-configuration is ran in (this is really powerful and explained below in detail)</li>
</ul>

<p>In our message-configuration we have the following <strong>Scope</strong> message configured:</p>

<pre><code>part Scope (
  ins (
    Socket ( named "socket" )
    ArrayByteBuffered ( named "requestBody" sizeGrowBy 1024 sizeInitial 1024 )
    ScopeGet ( named "respHead" scopeId -2 withName "Http200.Header" )
    ScopeGet ( named "respBody" scopeId -2 withName "Http200.Body.Html" )
    HttpHeader ( named "httpHeader" )
  )
  part Array ( ... )
)
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>part</em> named-message contains an <strong>Array</strong> message (more on that later). The <em>ins</em> named-message contains 5 messages, something like variables, each with a unique name within that Scope’s context:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Socket message named “socket” - The socket we use to read and write to the stream within the current thread.</li>
  <li>An ArrayByteBuffered message named “requestBody” - The buffer where the body of the request from the client is placed.</li>
  <li>A ScopeGet message named “respHead” - The header that will be sent to the client.</li>
  <li>Another ScopeGet message named “respBody” - The message body that will be sent to the client.</li>
  <li>An HttpHeader message named “httpHeader” - The http header received from the client.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here comes some programming power! A “variable” can be a single message like <strong>Socket</strong> or it can be another configured message! Yep! Just think of the power you have as a programmer. Variables are actually configured-messages!</p>

<p>Notice that, for this <strong>Scope</strong> message, the <em>scopeId</em> named-message is not defined. This means, the context of the Scope will be based on the current named thread. Yep! Even more <strong>POWER</strong>! We can run this message-configuration in as many threads as we want and there is no chance of the “variables” being accessed from multiple threads. You no longer need to worry about re-entrance or things being thread safe within this <strong>Scope</strong> (this isn’t the case when a <strong>Scope</strong> message is configured to be global).</p>

<p>In message-oriented programming, accessing a “Variable” is also done using messages. SipCoffee has no equals (=) operator. To access a “Variable” within the current scope, you use the <strong>ScopeGet</strong> message.</p>

<ul>
  <li>withName - The name of the “Variable”.</li>
  <li>named - The unique name of the ScopeGet message (so we can access a ScopeGet message from another ScopeGet message if we like).</li>
  <li>scopeId - When configured with a negative numeric message, the scope is “global” in nature. When not configured, the scopeId is based on the managed thread id a message-configuration is ran in (this is really powerful and explained below in detail).</li>
</ul>

<p>In this example:</p>

<pre><code>ScopeGet ( named "respHead" scopeId -2 withName "Http200.Body.Html" )
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>ScopeGet</strong> message locates and activates a message <em>named</em> “respHead” in a <em>scopeId</em> of -2. This is configured as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Scope ( scopeId -2
  ins (
    File ( named "Http200.Body.Html" fileUriStr "./Html/200.html" )
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p>Awesome! It looks like we have a “global variable” named ‘Http200.Body.Html’ that, when activated, reads from a file named ‘./Html/200.html’. </p>

<p>In this example:</p>

<pre><code>SocketReaderHeaderBody ( autoOpen true
  streamSource ScopeGet ( withName "socket" )
)  
</code></pre>

<p>the <em>streamSource</em> named-message of the <strong>SocketReaderHeaderBody</strong> is a <strong>ScopeGet</strong> message. That message is configured to locate a message named “socket” configured as follows:</p>

<pre><code>part Scope (
  ins (
    Socket ( named "socket" )
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p>Even more Awesome! It looks like we have not configured the scopeId meaning that this Scope is based on the managed thread id. When the <strong>SocketReaderHeaderBody</strong> is activated within a managed thread, the Scope is also contained within that managed thread.</p>

<h2 id="reading-from-and-writing-to-the-stream">Reading from and Writing to the Stream</h2>

<p>To activate messages in a given order, we can use an <em>Array</em> message setting the <em>run</em> named-message to a <strong>true</strong> message (Yep, even true is a message).</p>

<pre><code>Array ( run true
  ins ( ... )
)
</code></pre>

<p>Any messages in the <em>ins</em> named-message of the <em>Array</em> message are activated in the order they were inserted.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how the message-configuration works.</p>

<p>First, we activate a <strong>SocketReaderHeaderBody</strong> message:</p>

<pre><code>SocketReaderHeaderBody ( autoOpen true
  streamSource ScopeGet ( withName "socket" )
  data ArrayByteBuffered ( sizeGrowBy 1024 sizeInitial 1024 )
  body ScopeGet ( withName "requestBody" )
  headerEncoder ScopeGet ( withName "httpHeader" )
  buffer ArrayByteBuffered ( sizeInitial 1024 sizeGrowBy 1024 )
  terminator ArrayByte ( withArrayByte byte ( 13 10 13 10 ) )
)
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>autoOpen true - Automatically open the stream source.</li>
  <li>streamSource ScopeGet ( withName “socket” ) - the source of the stream is located in a Scoped “Variable” named ‘socket’</li>
  <li>data ArrayByteBuffered ( sizeGrowBy 1024 sizeInitial 1024 ) - The header data of the message is an ArrayByteBuffered with an initial size of 1024 bytes and grows by 1024 bytes to place the header data in.</li>
  <li>body ScopeGet ( withName “requestBody” ) - The body buffer is located in a Scoped “Variable” named ‘requestBody’</li>
  <li>headerEncoder ScopeGet ( withName “httpHeader” ) - The message to encode and decode the header is located in a Scoped “Variable” named “httpHeader”</li>
  <li>buffer ArrayByteBuffered ( sizeInitial 1024 sizeGrowBy 1024 ) - The buffer used directly by the socket is an ArrayByteBuffered with an initial size of 1024 bytes and grows by 1024 bytes to place the header data in.</li>
  <li>terminator ArrayByte ( withArrayByte byte ( 13 10 13 10 ) ) - The terminator between a message header and body is this ArraByte of 13 10 13 10 which happens to be the terminator between the header and body of html.</li>
</ul>

<p>Second, we write to the socket the response header:</p>

<pre><code>SocketWrite ( autoOpen false 
  streamSource ScopeGet ( withName "socket" )
  data ScopeGet ( withName "respHead" )
)
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>autoOpen false - Don’t auto open the data stream because we did that with the read above.</li>
  <li>streamSource ScopeGet ( withName “socket” ) - the source of the stream is located in a Scoped “Variable” named ‘socket’. Yep. The same streamSource as above.</li>
  <li>data ScopeGet ( withName “respHead” ) - Oh man! Awesome. We are accessing a Variable named “respHead” which is a ScopeGet message which accesses a “Variable” named “Http200.Header”. Of course, in future message-configurations, the response header to write could change.</li>
</ul>

<p>Third, we write to the socket the response body:</p>

<pre><code>SocketWrite ( autoOpen false 
  streamSource ScopeGet ( withName "socket" )
  data ScopeGet ( withName "respBody" )
)
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>autoOpen false - Yep! Still don’t auto open the data stream because we did that with the read above.</li>
  <li>streamSource ScopeGet ( withName “socket” ) - the source of the stream is located in a Scoped “Variable” named ‘socket’. Yep. The same streamSource as above.</li>
  <li>data ScopeGet ( withName “respBody” ) - Oh man! Awesome. We are accessing a Variable named “respBody” which is a ScopeGet message which accesses a “Variable” named “Http200.Body.Html”. We are writing to our socket the information located in a file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, we close the socket:</p>

<pre><code>NamedMessageGet ( withName "close" 
  part ScopeGet ( withName "socket" callBehavior false )
)
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>NamedMessageGet</strong> message causes a named message to activate. In this case, the named-message <em>close</em> (implementation is a calculated property accessed using reflection) of that same socket is activated.</p>

<p>And, once all of that runs we “fall-up” the message-configuration and the <strong>PartPoolDecorator</strong> message returns us to the PartPool to be used again!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Message-oriented programming kicks ass. In 50 lines of code, we are able to create a scalable web server that is able to keep up with the big names. We haven’t even started to optimize our underlying technology and it was written in C#. Imagine if it was implemented in something like <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> (aww please add calculated properties rust people!).</p>

<p>We have a data-structure of messages that is also the behavior of the program. That makes the message-configuration very easily re-used in a multi-threaded environment. We aren’t allocating memory all the time and we are able to activate message-configurations without the overhead of locking and worrying about re-entrance. We get the speed of “single threaded” programming in a multi-threaded environment. Woo hoo!</p>
